Hello and welcome to my blog! ðŸŽ‰

This is my very first post on this new platform, and I'm excited to share this journey with you. Let me tell you a bit about what you can expect from this space.

Sometimes I write in English, but since Chinese is always my mother language and I started to learn English systematically at middle school, forgive my mistakes.

## What This Blog Is About

This blog is my digital garden where I'll be sharing:

- **Technical insights** from my development journey
- **Learning experiences** and lessons learned
- **Project showcases** and code experiments  
- **Thoughts and reflections** on technology and life
- **Tutorials and guides** that might help fellow developers

## My Background

I'm a passionate developer who loves to explore new technologies and share knowledge with the community. Whether you're a beginner just starting out or an experienced developer, I hope you'll find something valuable here.

Starts as a tech and handcraft lover, I had my first building experience at a very young age, a hand-made attachable cardboard slide with design at the junction, which, at that stage, does nothing to do with electric, and just child's toy combined with my little sense of architecture.

While during the first year of my college, I started to get involved in electric and embedded system development. And build some open-source project on platforms like github and jialichuang. 

The third year in college is when I'm exposed to artificial intelligence and get very interested to it, it's why I chose to concentrate on robotics and join SII to do further research. I'm now a researcher in embodied intelligence and doing research on VLA(Visual Language Action model), feel free to contact me!

<!-- ### Code Highlighting
```javascript
// Code blocks look great and are easy to read
function welcomeReader(name) {
    console.log(`Welcome to the blog, ${name}!`);
    return 'Happy reading! ðŸ“š';
}

welcomeReader('fellow developer');
``` -->
